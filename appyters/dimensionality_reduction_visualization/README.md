An appyter for to perform visualization using PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP methods.

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

Data matrix with high dimensionality needs to be reduced into two or three dimensions to perform visualization. This appyter provides three prominent techniques for visualizing a high dimensionality data matrix.

## Two-Dimensional Plots

2-D interactive scatter plot that is colored based on one of the columns in the metadata you specified. Points are labeled by their categories and positions. The plot can be zoomed and dragged, and it can be downloaded as an SVG file.

## Three-Dimensional Plots

3-D interactive scatter plot that includes all functionalities of the 2-D plot. Notably, points can be viewed in three-dimensional space and be seen from different angles. Color and shape can be specific based on one of the columns in the metadata, and the plot can be downloaded as a PNG file.
