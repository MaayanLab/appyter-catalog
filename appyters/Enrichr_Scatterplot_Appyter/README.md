# Enrichr Scatterplot Appyter

This appyter creates a scatterplot which visualizes gene set enrichment results on a preprocessed Enrichr library.

The scatterplot is organized so that simliar gene sets are clustered together. Enriched gene sets will appear blue instead of gray, the darker tha blue the smaller the p-value. The name of the gene set and the associated p-value are displayed when a point is hovered over. The names and p-values of significant terms in each library are provided in tables output below the plot which can be downloaded. 

Individual plots can be downloaded as an svg using the save function on the toolbar next to the plot.
