# Enrichr Compressed Bar Chart Figure 

This appyter creates a publishable figure summarizing enrichment analysis results from Enrichr (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/).

The resulting figure will contain the top 5 enriched terms and their corresponding p-values for each library chosen. Colored bars correspond to terms with significant p-values (<0.05). An asterisk (*) next to a p-value indicates the term also has a significant adjusted p-value (<0.05).
