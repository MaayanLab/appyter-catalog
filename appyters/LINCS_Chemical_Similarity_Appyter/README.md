# LINCS Chemical Similarity Appyter
The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH Common Fund program that catalogs how human cells globally respond to chemical, genetic, and disease perturbations. Resources generated by LINCS include experimental and computational methods, visualization tools, molecular and imaging data, and signatures. 

This Appyter provides information about small molecules profiled by the LINCS program. Specifically, 
users can retrieve similar small molecules based on Tanimoto structural similarity and similarity based on L1000 gene expression.
