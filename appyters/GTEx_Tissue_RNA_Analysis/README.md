# GTEx RNA-seq Tissue Analysis

The GTEx RNA-seq Tissue Analysis Appyter is an application that facilitates the visualization and analysis of tissue-specific RNA-seq data obtained from the [Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx)](https://gtexportal.org/home/). 

Provided tissue datasets and related metadata have been preprocessed and formatted, the details of which can be found at the top of each notebook template. Users also have the option to upload their own RNAseq data and metadata, provided the format is similar to that of GTEx data. The Appyter itself provides a pipeline for normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, enrichment analysis, and visualization of the data. 

The Appyter also makes use of two Ma'ayan Lab visualization tools, the [React-Scatter-Board](https://github.com/MaayanLab/react-scatter-board) package for 2D/3D scatterplots and the [React-GSEA](https://github.com/MaayanLab/react-GSEA/tree/master) package for displaying Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) running sum graphs.
