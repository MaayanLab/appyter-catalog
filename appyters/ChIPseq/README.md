# ChIP-seq analysis pipeline

This pipeline enables you to analyze and visualize your ChIP-seq datasets with an array of downstream analysis and visualization tools. The pipeline includes peak calling with MACS2 (Zhang, Yong, et al., 2008), peak binding plots, an interactive genome browser, peak annotation, and enrichment analysis with Enrichr (Kuleshov, Maxim V., et al., 2016) and ChEA3 (Keenan, Alexandra B., et al., 2019).
