# Gene Set Library Synopsis
The Gene Set Library Synopsis Appyter processes, analyzes, and visualizes a gene set library. The required input is a GMT file containing a gene set library where all genes are represented as gene symbols. Users may also select an Enrichr library. The Appyter visualizes the gene set library as a scatterplot, analyzes similarity between gene sets and displays overlap through a heatmap, generates descriptive statistics, and assesses how well-studied the genes and gene sets are (novelty). The Appyter also determines the novelty of the userâ€™s library as a whole and compares that library to 188 Enrichr libraries on a scatterplot.
