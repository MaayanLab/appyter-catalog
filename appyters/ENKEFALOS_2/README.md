This appyter is the second part of the two-part ENKEFALOS analysis pipeline. This appyter will take a gene of interest (recommended to be a gene that was enriched based on the first ENKEFALOS appyter's analysis) and a neural electrophysiological/morphological measure of interest and provide you the plot/plot data for the relationship between the two measures. It will also take the list of enriched genes from your prior analysis and create a subset gene interactome network with your gene of interest at the center. You can find the description of the data and how it was derived [here](https://github.com/PavlidisLab/transcriptomic_correlates). Please note that this is the second part of the ENKEFALOS appyter analysis pipeline and in order for your analysis to be done properly, we suggest performing your analysis using the first ENKEFALOS appyter before this one.

There are several sections in this appyter, for which we have a brief overview below. If you would like a more comprehensive guide to how to use ENKEFALOS, please refer to our user guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15h8A65FygTK2_KLA_-6R8u8clJSRnF7yHLFAvN7BN6Y/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ola4n01ccsle).
  
Appyter 2
- Will give the option to create a smaller subset network given certain parameters.
- Will allow you to obtain multiple or singular correlation plots of a gene of interest and electrophysiological/morphological measures.
- Shows the plot data of the correlation plots of a gene of interest.
