# Gene-Aging-Trends-Appyter
Trace changes in expression of human and mouse genes with age

The appyter here takes a cleaned and parsed age data csv containing gene expression and age data from the ARCHS4 Mouse Matrix resource. 
Users currently are able to choose which gene they wish to view as well as control the degree of approximation for the spline. 
Additional features will be added as fit as the appyter is improved. 
Next feature is to partition by tissues once human data is added as well (alongside the ability to actually choose to look at human data or mouse data as opposed to the default mouse data).
