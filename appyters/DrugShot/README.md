# DrugShot
DrugShot is a search engine that accepts any biomedical search term to return a list of drugs that are mostly associated with the search term. A free text search is redirected to a PubMed search via the NCBI E-utilities API for retrieving publications that match the search terms. The resulting list of publications is cross-referenced with DrugRIF to convert PMIDs to lists of drugs. DrugRIF catalogs associations between publications and drugs. DrugShot returns the list of drugs ranked by their frequency of mentions within the publications returned by the search terms. In addition, the returned drugs from the initial query are supplanted with additional drugs based on DrugRIF literature co-mentions and L1000 signature similarity.
