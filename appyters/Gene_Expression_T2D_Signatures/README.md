# My Gene's Expression in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) Transcriptomics Signatures

This Appyter provides a volcano plot visualization of the expression levels of 
a given gene in various Type 2 Diabetes transcriptomics signatures. Users may 
enter in a single gene symbol as input; the output is a volcano plot which 
plots each T2D signature by gene-specific p-value (y-axis) and fold change 
(x-axis).
