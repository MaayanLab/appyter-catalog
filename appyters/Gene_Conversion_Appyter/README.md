# Gene Conversion Appyter

An appyter that facilitates converting various gene or transcript identifiers to official NCBI Entrez Gene Symbols leveraging the [NCBI Gene info database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3841/#EntrezGene.Quick_Start).

Though currently only Mammalia genes conversions are considered, it is trivial to apply to any organism available in [NCBI's FTP Server](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/).
