# Compare-Sets-Appyter
This appyter creates a Venn diagram to visualize the intersections between 2-6 user-inputted gene sets. The user has a choice whether to uplaod a tsv file with the desired genes or to insert the genes into text boxes. Three default gene sets are provided. 

Users also have the option to use Fisher's Exact Test to see whether the overlap of two gene sets is significant. After adding their own gene sets, the user can select which ones they would like to compare, their desired significance level, and their background.
