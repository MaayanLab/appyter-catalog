# Compare-Sets-Appyter
This appyter visualizes the intersections between 2-6 user-inputted gene/drug sets. The user has a choice whether to upload a tsv file with the desired genes or to insert the genes into text boxes. Three default gene sets are provided. 

Visualization options include Venn diagrams and UpSet plots. UpSet plots can be more useful than Venn diagrams when trying to visualize more than three or four sets. Users can customize their figures by changing the colors and other features. 

Users also have the option to use Fisher's Exact Test to see whether the overlap of two gene sets is significant. After adding their own gene sets, the user can select which ones they would like to compare, their desired significance level, and their background.
