# What Is An Appyter?

Appyters are web-based applications that introduce users with a data entry form. After filling up the form by uploading or fetching data, and selection options for various settings, the user is presented with a Jupyter Notebook report that is automatically executed in the cloud. The report includes markdown text, interactive and static figures, and the source code. Users can share the link to the executed report with their colleagues, as well as download the fully executable notebook for execution on other modification on other platforms. Appyters extent the Jupyter Notebook language to support external environment variables. Appyters can be considered a meta Jupyter Notebook language that is compatible with standard Jupyter Notebook execution. The Appyter meta Jupyter Notebook language adds Jupyter "magics" which permit constructing output Python code with jinja2, declaration of injectable variables by means of pre-defined, or extendable "fields", and a mechanism to turn the meta Jupyter Notebook language into full-stack web-based applications. Such Appyter web-based applications facilitate users to submit their data via the web-based form, satisfying the defined fields followed by rendering and execution of a standard Jupyter Notebook given that input.

Appyters extends biojupies by permitting rapid construction of biojupies-like applications based off of the same jupyter notebook reports that are produced, helping to turn any data analysis into a highly-accessible parameterized web application.
