# Running Appyters Locally

Appyters are served by us publicly, but can also be run by you on your local machine, on your web-server, or in the cloud. There are several ways you can run your Appyters on another platform. The easiest way to begin is to use the Docker images we have already built for each Appyter. These Docker images contain all the necessary dependencies you would need to run the Appyter locally on your computer, on your web-server, or in the cloud.

You can run the appyter application as a Dockerized command-line application which allows you to achieve the following:
- Serve a live Jupyter notebook containing the notebook you created *using* the public Appyters Catalog platform so you can re-execute or modify the workflow
- Serve it as a web-form the same way it appears on our system (Appyters Catalog)
- Create or execute Appyters as a command-line application to be a part of a greater computational workflow

## Step 1: Install Docker
Download, install, and run Docker on your computer if you do not yet have it installed. Please follow the instructions provided from [the official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).
