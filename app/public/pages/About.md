## About the Project

Jupyter notebooks have transformed the communication of data analysis pipelines by facilitating a modular structure that brings together code, markdown text, and interactive visualizations to increase transparency and reproducibility. Appyters extended Jupyter notebooks to broaden their accessibility by turning Jupyter notebooks into fully functional standalone web-based bioinformatics applications. Each Appyter presents to users an entry form enabling them to upload their data and set various parameters for executing multitude of bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Once the form is filled, the Appyter executes the corresponding notebook in the cloud, producing a report without requiring the user to interact directly with the code. Appyters can be applied to a variety of workflows including building customized machine learning pipelines, analyzing omics data, and producing publishable figures. These Appyters are served in the Appyters Catalog at: [https://appyters.maayanlab.cloud](/#/). Advanced users can [create](/#/creating-appyters/) and [publish](/#/publishing-appyters/) their own Appyters to enable the rapid development of web-based bioinformatics applications by the community.
