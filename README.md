# Gene Set Library Synopsis
This is an Appyter that performs basic analysis on a GMT file containing a gene set library. Currently, the Appyter will count how many times each gene appears in the file, generate a list of unmapped gene names in date formats (ex: 1-DEC, 1-MAR, and 1-SEP), and visualize the most common genes in an interactive bar graph.
