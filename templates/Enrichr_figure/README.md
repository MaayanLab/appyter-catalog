# Enrichr Figure 

This template creates a publishable figure summarizing enrichment analysis results from Enrichr. 

The resulting figure will contain the top 5 enriched terms and their corresponding p-values for each library chosen. Red bars correspond to terms with significant p-values (<0.05). An asterisk (*) next to a p-value indicates the term also has a significant adjusted p-value (<0.05).
